## UX Design

### Site Owner Goals

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to find easy to understand content about mindfulness and stress management tools.
- As a user, I want to use different timers to encourage me to take a break from work.
- As a user, I want to listen to calming sounds.
- As a user, I want to be able to control whether I listen to the sounds or not.

### **Existing Features**
* Responsive design- the site has been developed using Bootstrap and custom CSS to ensure the site is responsive across all devices.
* Interactive chat box
* Timers- the site includes timers that enables the user to select a timer for a time out session. This encourages the user to take some time out from there day and can hold the user accountable. It's easy to say that you will take 5 minutes but when it is timed it is more likely to happen.
* Writing feature- the site includes an option for users to write down how they are feeling. This content is not saved and is cleared as soon as the user hits clear or the page is refreshed. Writing thoughts and feelings down is a really good way of letting go of stresses and frustrations. For the user, knowing it is not saved  can help people truly let go.
* Checklist- The Daily Lift Page includes a checklist where users can check off a number of items that can contribute to a happy and productive day at work. 
* Modal pop ups- On the checklist, when a user checks an item off a modal pops up with a positive message and affirmation. This is to continue to contribute to the positive work the user is attaining by using the site. 
* Social media links- In the footer there are links to various social media links, to allow users to continue to follow Mindscape.
* About page- Gives users a good understanding of why the site exists and what its mission is.



### **Features Left to Implement**
* Registration/Login - In the future users can register for an account and login. Users can then save information from the checklist and see there improvements over time, if they wish.

### Changes to Wireframes


### Colour Scheme

The colours for the site were chosen using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). The team decided that colours that reflected a sense of calmness and serenity was important, as not to further stress out the user. From this the team decided on the below palette. It is a combination of different shades of greens with a peach and purple.

### Images

The hero image on the home page is a beach scene. This was chosen to give an immediate sense of relief and relaxtion. 

### Typography

The fonts used in the site have been chosen to ensure the user can understand and enjoy the content with ease, whilst still being appealing. The main body font is called 'Dosis', which is clear and easy to read. The team wanted a font that did not complicate the experience for the user. The navbar font is called 'Indie Flower' and is a cursive font. This is flowing and adds to the calming feeling of the site. Originally it was going to be used throughout the site, but the team decided against this at a lot this font made it hard to read. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to select the fonts.
